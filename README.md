# Archive
This is a collection of my old (or recent) and somewhat random collections of scripts in Roblox. 
Some of them aren't updated or don't quite work efficiently!

There is no particular order or functioning to how these scripts work, it's more of like a showcase. If you'd like to either take the scripts for use in your games or read them for knowledge and understanding, go ahead :)
Even updating the scripts to your liking and using them is okay too, after all, it's MIT-licensed!
